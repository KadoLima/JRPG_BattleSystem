# JRPG_BattleSystem
Old school JRPG's always had a special place in my heart, so I decided to recreate a classic turn-based battle system during my studies.

**WORK IN PROGRESS** - I'll be updating this ReadMe as features get implemented into the battle system.

Recently implemented:
- [Player] Normal attack and cooldown bar;
- [Player + Enemies] Main animations and effects;
- [Enemies] HP losing and death;

Currently working on: 
- [Player] Single target and multi-target skills;
